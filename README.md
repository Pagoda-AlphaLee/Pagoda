# A ZeroMQ-based Communication Library
It cannot be used directly.
### 1. Installation
```bash
pip install pyzmq
pip install PagodaAL (If the package is not available in the mirror, run: pip install PagodaAL==0.1.0 -i https://pypi.org/simple)
```

### 2. Usage Instructions
#### 1) Import the PagodaAL Package as Follows
```python
from pagodaAL.zmqclass import ZmqManager
```

#### 2) Import the Log Package as Follows
```python
import logging
```

#### 3) Configure Logging
Logging is implemented to enhance code robustness and resilience. For the complete sample code, refer to the specific test documentation.
```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - ZmqManager - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

#### 4) Create an Object Instance
Only the interfaces required by users are exposed. The `ip` refers to the bus IP, the receiving port is the bus REP port number, and the subscription port is the bus PUB port number.
```python
# Initialize the manager (IP, sender port, receiver port, subscription topics)
zmq_manager = ZmqManager(
    ip="127.0.0.1",
    sender_port=1111,
    receiver_port=2222,
    subscribe_topics=["test"]
)
```

#### 5) Send Messages
Users send messages that comply with the command specifications to the bus through this function.
```python
send_success = zmq_manager.send("test_message")
```

#### 6) Receive Messages
Users receive commands published by the bus (including status returns) through this function. The lifecycle of this function ends when its independent thread terminatesâ€”i.e., when the main thread terminates the independent thread of this function or the main function ends.
```python
received = zmq_manager.receive()
```
